# PythonPyrus
Pyrus is a beginner-level Python script created by a rookie coder with the goal of pranking friends by simulating a dramatic system failure. Once executed, Pyrus:

Captures the Current Desktop – The script takes an instant screenshot of the user's desktop, creating a static visual illusion.

Freezes the System Interface – To sell the effect, it disables user input or overlays the screenshot full-screen, making the system appear unresponsive.

Launches a Fake "Microsoft Recovery" Animation – A fullscreen slideshow or animation mimicking a Microsoft system crash screen appears, complete with:

A familiar blue recovery-style design,

A percentage counter steadily increasing to simulate a "system restoration process."

The prank is harmless in intent and doesn’t cause actual damage—just an illusion of a catastrophic crash. It's meant to be fun, surprising, and a good learning experience for the coder who built it.

Disclaimer:
Pyrus is strictly for educational and entertainment purposes. It should never be used on someone’s machine without clear consent. Scripts that freeze input or imitate system failures can be interpreted as malware or scareware. Always respect the legal and ethical boundaries of programming.
